> [![homepage](http://commonmark.org/help/images/favicon.png)](http://commonmark.org "Redirect to homepage")

Which is doing these steps:

Embedding an image called favicon.png in the document.
Giving the image the alternative text “homepage”.
Putting the complete Markdown image tag inside of a Markdown link (in the part where the link’s visible text normally goes).
Giving the outer link the URL http://commonmark.org, so that when someone clicks on the image, it will take them to that URL.
Giving the outer link the title “Redirect to homepage” (which appears when hovering with your mouse over the link in most desktop operating systems).
If you think this syntax is hard to read, that’s because it is. And to be honest, I think the more explicit HTML rendering of it is clearer.
